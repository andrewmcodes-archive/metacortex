This repository contains common configurations for building web apps inspired by Shopify's quilt & web-configs.

## Usage

This repo is managed as a monorepo that is composed of many npm packages, where each package has its own `README` and documentation describing usage.

### Package Index

### Development

#### Getting Started

```bash
yarn
yarn lerna bootstrap
```

#### Testing your changes in a local project

To try out your changes in another locally cloned project, you can use `yarn tophat <package-name-without-@andrewmcodes-prefix> <relative-path-to-project>`. Using this command rather than `yarn link` will set up a watcher let you make changes without needing to rerun any commands.

Example: To test my changes to `@andrewmcodes/fucemol` in my local project named `my-project`, I would run `yarn tophat fucemol ../path/to/my-project`.

#### Testing

The packages in this repository are used in mission-critical production scenarios. As such, we do not merge any untested code.

To run the full test suite, run `yarn test`.
